"""Two-stage Gated-Residual ``combine_and_mix`` op.

The fused two-stage kernel uses ``K1`` for combine + grouped-RMSNorm + down GEMM
(:func:`~.k1.flydsl_k1_combine_norm_down`) and ``K2`` for SiLU + up GEMM + gated
mean (:func:`~.k2.flydsl_up_gate_mix_norm`). K2 re-forms ``xn`` from stored
``r2``, so ``xn`` never touches HBM.
