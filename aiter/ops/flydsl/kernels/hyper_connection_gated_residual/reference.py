"""Numerical reference for the Gated-Residual combine-and-mix operator.

Gated Residual is the gated variant of HyperConnections (arXiv:2409.19606). The
hidden state carries ``hc_count`` parallel residual streams, flattened as
``[tokens, hc_count * stream_dim]`` with the stream index outer and ``stream_dim``
inner. Each transformer sublayer collapses those streams into a single
``stream_dim`` input, runs its block, then injects the block output back into
every stream.

``combine_and_mix`` fuses two adjacent sublayer boundaries: it *combines* a
pending block output back into the residual streams, then runs the *mix* that
produces the next block input. For one token row (``s`` indexes the stream):

    combine     r2[s]    = r[s] + y * (2 * sigmoid(inj[s] / hc_count))
    norm        xn[s]    = rmsnorm(r2[s]) * (1 + norm_weight)      # per stream
    down        lora     = xn @ w_down.T                           # [lowrank]
    activation  lora     = silu(lora / hc_count)
    up          gate     = lora @ w_up.T                           # [hc_count*dim]
    gated mean  x        = mean_s sigmoid(gate[s]) * xn[s]         # [stream_dim]
    injection   inj_next = xn @ w_inject.T                         # [hc_count]

The kernel accepts ``w_down`` and ``w_inject`` as one merged projection. This
reference keeps them separate and preserves their concatenation order.
``w_inject`` is ``None`` for the final mixer, which emits no new injection.

The pure-PyTorch implementation is the shared oracle for each kernel variant.
It matches kernel numerics by rounding the combined residual and GEMM operands
to bfloat16 while accumulating GEMMs in float32. Pass ``round_bf16=False`` to
evaluate the operator entirely in float32.
